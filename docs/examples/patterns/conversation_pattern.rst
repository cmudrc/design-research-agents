Conversation Pattern
====================

Source: ``examples/patterns/conversation_pattern.py``

Introduction
------------

AutoGen-style multi-agent conversations can externalize reasoning roles, Human-AI collaboration by design
explains why role separation matters for oversight, and AI-assisted design synthesis work motivates
structured dialogue in design ideation. This example implements a two-agent conversation loop with trace
visibility at each turn.

Technical Implementation
------------------------

1. Configure ``Tracer`` with JSONL + console output so each run emits machine-readable traces and lifecycle logs.
2. Build the runtime surface (public APIs only) and execute ``ConversationPattern.run(...)`` with a fixed
   ``request_id``.
3. Capture structured outputs from runtime execution and preserve termination metadata for analysis.
4. Print a compact JSON payload including ``trace_info`` for deterministic tests and docs examples.
